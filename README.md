# Lines95
Line up 5 balls (or more) to remove them, and try achieving the highest score before you cannot move. The original source code for this game was created by Anatoly Podgoretsky. Since he shared it "as is with no liability", I share it here under a MIT license. I stripped down the source code to purely the game part. Compiles in Turbo Delphi.
